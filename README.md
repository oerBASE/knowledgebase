# OER knowledgebase
helpful information for designing, setting up and maintaining a repository for open educational resources. Can only be activated by the power of the Force

## How does it work?
The OER Knowledgebase uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) as a static site generator.

The content in this git repository is converted into static `html` with some `css` styling, some `javascript` (for search, flowcharts and syntax highlighting, but the site also works without `javascript`).

## TL;DR - How do i submit changes?
1) [Fork](https://github.com/oerBASE/knowledgebase/fork) this repo (or apply for developer status on this repo and make a [branch](https://github.com/oerBASE/knowledgebase/branches).)
2) Edit or create `.md` files following the [Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/de/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) under the `docs` directory.
3) Submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/oerBASE/knowledgebase/pulls) from your repo/branch. After review by the repo maintainers, your changes will be merged into the `main` branch and be visible on the website.
