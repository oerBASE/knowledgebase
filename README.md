## How does it work?
The OER Knowledgebase uses [doctave](https://www.doctave.com/) as a static site generator.

The content in this git repository is converted into static `html` with some `css` styling, some `javascript` (for search, flowcharts and syntax highlighting, but the site also works without `javascript`).

For more information on doctave's features please visit: https://cli.doctave.com/features/
